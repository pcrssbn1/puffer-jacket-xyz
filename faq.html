<summary>What is a puffer jacket?</summary>
<p>A puffer jacket is a quilted winter coat filled with down or synthetic insulation that creates a puffy appearance. The quilted construction creates individual chambers, typically 2-4 inches square, that prevent the insulation from shifting and creating cold spots. This design was patented by Eddie Bauer in 1940 after he nearly died from hypothermia on a fishing trip. The insulation—either natural down feathers or synthetic polyester fibers—traps air within its structure, and since air is an excellent insulator with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity">thermal conductivity</a> of just 0.024 W/mK, this trapped air creates a barrier against cold. Modern puffer jackets range from ultralight 6-ounce packable versions for mild weather to expedition-weight parkas rated for temperatures below -40°F.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Are puffer jackets warm enough for winter?</summary>
<p>Yes, puffer jackets are excellent for winter weather, but the specific warmth depends on insulation type and amount. High-quality down puffer jackets with 700-800 fill power can keep you comfortable in temperatures from 0-10°F, while 850-900 fill expedition jackets handle extreme cold below -20°F. Synthetic puffer jackets with 150-200g insulation per square meter provide comparable warmth to 650-700 fill down. The key is matching the jacket to your climate—a 550-fill down jacket works fine for 30-40°F weather but fails in subzero conditions. The shell fabric also matters; windproof shells prevent convective heat loss, which can make you feel 20-30°F colder in windy conditions. For urban winter use in most U.S. climates, a 650-700 fill down or 120-150g synthetic puffer provides adequate warmth.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you wash a puffer jacket?</summary>
<p>Most puffer jackets can be machine washed, but the process differs for down versus synthetic fill. For down jackets, use a front-loading washer on gentle cycle with specialized down soap like Nikwax Down Wash or Grangers Down Wash, as regular detergents strip the natural oils that help down maintain loft. Use cool to warm water, never hot. The drying process is critical—tumble dry on low heat for 2-3 hours, adding 2-3 clean tennis balls or dryer balls to break up clumps and restore loft. Check every 30 minutes and manually break up any clumps. For synthetic jackets, regular mild detergent works fine on a normal gentle cycle, and drying takes only 1-2 hours on low heat. Always close all zippers and turn the jacket inside out before washing. Spot clean whenever possible to reduce washing frequency—down jackets should only be fully washed 1-2 times per season to preserve insulation quality.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between down and synthetic puffer jackets?</summary>
<p>Down puffer jackets use natural waterfowl feathers and offer superior warmth-to-weight ratio, with 800-fill down providing exceptional insulation at just 10-12 ounces for a full jacket. Down compresses smaller, lasts longer (15-20 years with proper care), and feels softer against skin. However, down loses 90% of its insulating ability when wet and takes 8-12 hours to dry completely. Synthetic puffer jackets use polyester insulation like PrimaLoft or Thinsulate, which maintains about 85% of warmth when wet, dries in 2-4 hours, and costs 40-60% less than comparable down jackets. The tradeoff is weight and bulk—synthetic jackets weigh 30-40% more and compress less effectively. Synthetic insulation also degrades faster, typically lasting 8-12 years. For wet climates or active use where you'll sweat, synthetic makes sense. For cold, dry conditions where weight matters, down is superior. Some manufacturers now offer hybrid designs with synthetic in moisture-prone areas and down in the core for balanced performance.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How should a puffer jacket fit?</summary>
<p>A puffer jacket should fit comfortably with 2-4 inches of ease around your chest to allow for layering a sweater or fleece underneath without restricting movement. The sleeves should reach the base of your thumb when arms hang naturally at your sides—this prevents gaps when you reach forward. The jacket hem should fall at your hip bone for standard length, mid-thigh for longer styles, or at your waist for cropped versions. When you raise your arms overhead, the jacket should not ride up more than 2-3 inches. Check the shoulder seams—they should sit at the edge of your shoulder, not drooping down your arm or pulling tight. The zipper should close smoothly without fabric straining or buckling. For women's jackets, ensure adequate room in the bust without excess fabric bunching under the arms. For men, check that the shoulders accommodate your frame without pulling across the back. Try the jacket with the layers you'll actually wear—a jacket that fits perfectly over a t-shirt may be too tight over a thick sweater. Most technical brands offer multiple fit options: slim/athletic, regular, and relaxed.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can you wear a puffer jacket in the rain?</summary>
<p>Most puffer jackets can handle light rain or snow for 15-30 minutes thanks to DWR (Durable Water Repellent) coatings on the shell fabric, but they're not designed for prolonged wet conditions. The DWR coating causes water to bead up and roll off rather than soaking in, but this coating degrades over time and needs reapplication every 1-2 years. In moderate to heavy rain, water will eventually penetrate the shell and reach the insulation. This is particularly problematic for down jackets—once down gets wet, it clumps together, loses loft, and provides minimal warmth until completely dried. Synthetic insulation performs better when wet, retaining about 85% of its warmth even when damp. For rainy climates, consider a synthetic puffer jacket or wear a waterproof shell over your down jacket. Some manufacturers like Arc'teryx and Outdoor Research make fully waterproof puffer jackets with sealed seams and waterproof-breathable fabrics, though these cost $400-600. If your puffer gets wet, remove it, wring out excess water gently, and dry it as soon as possible on low heat with tennis balls.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What does fill power mean in down jackets?</summary>
<p>Fill power measures the loft or fluffiness of down insulation, specifically how many cubic inches one ounce of down fills when fully expanded. A 700-fill down jacket means one ounce of that down expands to fill 700 cubic inches of space. Higher fill power indicates better quality down with larger, more mature feather clusters that trap more air with less weight. Fill power ranges from 450 (budget quality) to 900+ (premium expedition grade). A 800-fill jacket provides the same warmth as a 600-fill jacket but weighs 25-30% less and compresses smaller. However, fill power alone doesn't determine total warmth—you also need to consider fill weight, which is the total ounces of down in the jacket. A jacket with 4 ounces of 800-fill down is warmer than one with 2 ounces of 800-fill down. Most quality winter jackets use 650-750 fill power, while ultralight backcountry jackets use 800-900 fill. Below 550 fill power, you're better off choosing synthetic insulation for similar cost and better wet-weather performance. The <a href="https://www.responsibledown.org/">Responsible Down Standard</a> certification ensures down is ethically sourced, which doesn't affect fill power but matters for animal welfare.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long do puffer jackets last?</summary>
<p>Down puffer jackets last 15-20 years with proper care, while synthetic puffer jackets typically last 8-12 years before insulation degradation becomes noticeable. The lifespan depends heavily on use frequency, storage conditions, and maintenance. A down jacket worn daily for 4-5 months per year might last 10-12 years, while one worn occasionally for 1-2 months annually could last 20+ years. The main failure points are shell fabric abrasion, zipper failure, and insulation breakdown. Down maintains its loft longer than synthetic materials because the natural feather structure resiliently springs back after compression. Synthetic fibers gradually lose their crimp and ability to trap air, losing about 10% of warmth every 2-3 years. Proper storage is critical—never store puffer jackets compressed for more than a few weeks, as constant compression permanently damages insulation structure. Store loosely hung or in breathable bags in cool, dry locations. Quality construction also matters significantly—jackets with reinforced stress points, YKK zippers, and ripstop fabrics outlast budget models by years. Many premium brands like Patagonia and The North Face offer repair services that can extend jacket life by another 5-10 years. The higher initial cost of quality jackets often proves economical over their extended lifespan.</p>
